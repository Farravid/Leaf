Leaf is a multiplatform data oriented engine developed in my spare time in order to improve my skills and knowledge about game engine architectures.

The targets of this project are pretended to be experienced programmers. This means, some features can have a less family friendly interface in order to achieve more performance. 

It's written in modern C++20.
